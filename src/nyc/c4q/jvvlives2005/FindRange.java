/**
 * Created by Joshelyn on 12/5/15.
 *
 * Problem #2: Write a program that reads in a list of integers, one per line, until a sentinel value of 0 (which you should be able to
 * change easily to some other value). When the sentinel is read, your program should display the smallest and largest values
 * in the list, as illustrated in this sample run:
 *
 Your program should handle the following special cases:
 • If the user enters only one value before the sentinel, the program should report that value as both the largest and smallest.
 • If the user enters the sentinel on the very first input line, then no values have been entered, and your program should
 display a message to that effect.
