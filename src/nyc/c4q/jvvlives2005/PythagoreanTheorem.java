Problem #1: The Pythagorean theorem for the relationship of the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle:
 a2 + b2 = c2 which can alternatively be written as: c =a2+b2

 Write a program that accepts values for a and b as doubles (you can assume that a and b will be positive) and then
 calculates the solution of c as a double. Your program should be able to duplicate the following sample run:
